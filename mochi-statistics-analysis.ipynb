    "The easiest way to enable monitoring in Mochi is by setting the `MARGO_ENABLE_MONITORING` environment variable before running your service and application. Margo will use default configuration values for its monitoring system and each process will produce a JSON file in the current working directory upon finalizing margo, with the name _\"margo.\\<hostname>.\\<pid>.stats.json\"_. If you wish to replace the \"margo\" part with something else, simply set the `MARGO_MONITORING_FILENAME_PREFIX` environment variable to the prefix you wish to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may set the `monitor` field of the `margo_init_info` structure that you pass to `margo_init_ext` to `margo_default_monitor`. This will make margo enable monitoring by default, unless specified otherwise in the margo JSON configuration.\n",

If an RPC is called with no parent, its callpath will show as `65535:65535:<rpc_id>:<provider_id>` (the number `65535` is due to the way margo encodes RPC and provider ids internally).

In the file created by `B`, we will find a callpath `65535:65535:12345:42` with a `target` section containing a `received from <address of A>` section.

    "A process sending an RPC will start by creating an `hg_handle_t` object using `margo_create`. It will then call `margo_forward` (or one of its variants). Under the hood, a blocking _forward_ call is always executed as a non-blocking `margo_iforward` (or equivalent) call followed by a `margo_wait`. The `iforward` call will internally serialize the RPC's argument in a `set_input` step, before asking Mercury to send the RPC. Eventually, the RPC completes and the `forward_cb` callback is called by Mercury, unblocking the `wait` call. Finally to retrieve the data sent by the target of the RPC, `margo_get_output` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitoring system in margo tracks statistics for each of these operations, apart from the `create` operation. For each of the operations described above and corresponding blocks on the figure on the left, the  JSON files will contain two entries: a _\"relative_timestamp_from_X\"_ entry, and a _\"duration\"_ entry. As their names indicate, the latter contains statistics on the duration of the block and the former contains statistics on the time between a certain operation and the beginning of the considered block. For instance the `iforward` block will have a _relative_timestamp_from_create_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having such detailed statistics enables computing more coarse-grain metrics. For instance, to compute the average amount of time a process spent calling a given RPC, we can simply add up the _avg_ fields of the `get_output`'s _relative_timestamp_from_wait_end_ entry, its _duration_ entry, the `iforward_wait`'s _relative_timestamp_from_iforward_end_ and _duration_, and the `iforward`'s _duration_. To compute just the time spent on a `margo_forward` for this RPC, we can add the `iforward_wait`'s _relative_timestamp_from_iforward_end_ and _duration_, and the `iforward`'s _duration_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such detailed statistics also enable finding in which block our program spends the most of its time. Normally, we would want for the largest block to be `iforward_wait`, since this is the block that waits for the RPC response to come back. A long `set_input` or `get_output` operation may indicate a serialization overhead (if you transfer large amounts of data, consider using RDMA instead). A long `iforward` operation may indicate overhead in transferring the data over the network.\n"

This handler performs some checks on the RPC (such as finding out the Argobots pool in which the RPC should be executed) before creating a ULT for the RPC and pushing it into a pool. Eventually, the `ult` starts executing. Such an RPC will typically start by retrieveing the RPC's arguments using `margo_get_input`, before performing some computations. It will then respond to the sender. Similarly to how margo treats `forward` calls as a non-blocking `iforward` followed by a `wait`, it also treats `margo_respond` as a `margo_irespond` followed by a `margo_wait`. The `irespond` step will first execute a `set_output` step to serialize the response's data into Mercury's buffer, before asking Mercury to send the response. Once Mercury has sent the response, it calls a `respond_cb` callback to unblock `margo_wait`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the order of operations may not line up like in the figure. For instance, if the receiver process responds immediately to the sender, and get the input afterward, the `get_input` block will show up after the `irespond`, `set_output`, `irespond_wait`, and `respond_cb`. The `ult` could also create an anonymous ULT from which processing is done and from which `margo_respond` is eventually called, leading to the `ult` block terminating before the other blocks even start!"

    "### Callpath inference\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be surprised to see that the margo monitoring system is able to infer from which RPC the bulk operations are done, even though `margo_bulk_create` and `margo_bulk_transfer` don't take the RPC handle as argument, or that `margo_forward` is called within the context of another RPC, even though it doesn't take the parent RPC handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Margo, in fact, makes a best attempt at infering the context in which these operations occure by relying on [Argobots keys](https://www.argobots.org/doxygen/latest_dev/d0/d5e/group__KEY.html) attached to ULTs. The downside of this is that such callpath inference is only possible if `margo_forward`, `margo_bulk_create` and `margo_bulk_transfer` are called within the ULT created by margo to execute the RPC. If this ULT itself creates other ULTs from which these functions are called, the callpath will be lost, unless the service implementer has taken precaution to call `margo_set_current_rpc_id` in the new ULTs to propagate the Argobots keys."
